# Mental-Health-Survey-Data-Analysis
We have selected a dataset that is prepared on a survey of mental health issues on the people of different countries. Necessary inputs like family history, interference frequency in work, previously sought help or not, employment type, number of employees in the office etc. are taken as independent features. Based on these features we would try to predict whether a new person with a given set of features would be willing to go for treatment or not. Different Machine Learning models are applied after suitable pre-processing, they are compared and finally a neural network autoencoder was applied on the dataset to observe the difference with Machine Learning models.
